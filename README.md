# EpicRpgCounters

This is a basic code for a Discord Bot that counts your daily commands in the widely popular rpg game on discord called 'Epic RPG'.
I have used mongoose database for storing the counters until the end of the day. 

> Don't change the code if you don't know what you are doing xD

I used *node-cron* module to reset the leaderboard everyday at a certain time of the day. Make sure to learn how node cron syntax works so that you can work with it.
> Also, fill the *config.json* with appropriate details and keep the details confidential.

Feel free to use/modify the code but make sure to give me the credits xD
